We're a group of four students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology 
who want to help keep our school clean. Students at TJ are able to eat anywhere in the 
school during lunch, and this puts a burden on our hardworking custodians. We can make
their jobs easier (and keep our school pest-free) simply by cleaning up after ourselves
after lunch. Students typically eat in commons areas and in the cafeteria, and if we 
assign a few volunteers to each area, we can make a big difference. Let's get together to
*make TJ's floors great again!*
